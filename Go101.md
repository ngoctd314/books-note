## Channels in Go

The information in this article may be sightly challenging for new gophers. Some parts of this article may need to be read several times to be fully understood.

### Channel Introduction

One suggestion (made by Rob Pike) for concurrent programming is **don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.**

Communicating by sharing memory and sharing memory by communicating are two programming manners in concurrent programming. When goroutines communicate by sharing memory, we use traditional concurrency synchronization techniques, such as mutex locks, to protect the shared memory to prevent data races. We can use channels to implement sharing memory by communicating.


### Channel Value Comparisons

All channel types are comparable types.
From the article value parts, we know that non-nil channel values are multi-part values. If not channel value is assigned to another, the two channels share the same underlying part(s). In other words, those two channels represent the same internal channel object. The result of comparing them is true.

### Channel Operations

There are five channel specified operations. Assume the channel is ch, their syntax and function calls of these operations are listed here. (i) close, (ii) send value to channel, (iii) receive value from channel, (iv) query the value buffer capacity, (v) query the current of values n the buffer (or the length).

Most basic operations in Go are not synchronized. In other words, they are not concurrency-safe. These operations include value assignments, argument passing and container element manipulations, etc. However, all the just introduced channel operations are already synchronized, so no further synchronizations are needed to safety perform these operation.

Like most other operations in Go, channel value assignments are not synchronized. Similarly, assigning the received value to another value is also not synchronized, though any channel receive operation is synchronized.

### Detailed Explanation for Channel Operations


|Operation|A Nil Channel|A Closed Channel|A Not-Closed Non-nil Channel|
|-|-|-|-|
|Close|Panic|Panic|Success to close(C)|
|Send Value To|Block for ever|Panic|Block or succeed to send(B)|
|Receive Value From|Block for ever|Never block(D)|Block or succeed to receive(A)|

### Channel Element Values Are Transferred by Copy

When a value if transferred from one goroutine to another goroutine, the value will be copied at least one time. If the transferred value ever stayed in the value buffer of a channel, then two copies will happen in transfer process. One copy happens when the value is copied from the sender goroutine into the value buffer, the other happens when the value is copied from the value buffer to the receiver goroutine. So if the passed value size is too large, it is best to use a pointer element type instead, to avoid a large value copy cost. 

### The Implementation of the Select Mechanism

There are several steps to execute a select-case block:
1. Evaluate all involved channel expression and value expressions to be potentially sent in case operations, from top to bottom and left to right

## Channel Use Cases

The remaining of this article will show many channel use cases. I hope this article will convince you that:

- Asynchronous and concurrency programming with Go channels is easy and enjoyable.
- The channel synchronization technique has a wider range of uses and has more variations than the synchronization solutions used in some other languages, such as the actor mode and the async/await pattern.

### Use Channels as Futures/Promises

Futures and promises are used in many other popular languages. They are often associated with requests and responses.

**Return receive-only channels (async) as results**

In the following example, the values of two arguments of the sumSquares function call are requested concurrently. Each of the two channel receive operations will block until a send operation performs on the corresponding channel. It takes about three seconds instead of six seconds to return the final result. 

```go
func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())
	// async
	a, b := longTimeRequest(), longTimeRequest()

	// wait async result
	fmt.Println(sumSquares(<-a, <-b))
	fmt.Println("since: ", time.Since(now))
}

func longTimeRequest() <-chan int32 {
	r := make(chan int32)
	go func() {
		// Simulate a workload
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
		r <- rand.Int31n(100)
		close(r)
	}()

	return r
}

func sumSquares(a, b int32) int32 {
	return a*a + b*b
}
```

**Pass send-only channels as arguments**

```go
func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())
	r := make(chan int32, 2)
	// async
	go longTimeRequest(r)
	go longTimeRequest(r)

	// wait async result
	fmt.Println(sumSquares(<-r, <-r))
	fmt.Println("since: ", time.Since(now))
}

func longTimeRequest(r chan<- int32) {
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	r <- rand.Int31n(100)
}

func sumSquares(a, b int32) int32 {
	return a*a + b*b
}
```
### The first response wins

Sometimes, a piece of data can be received from several sources to avoid high latencies. For a lot of factors, the response durations of these sources may vary much. Even for a specified source, its response durations are also not constant. To make the response duration as short as possible, we can send a request to every source in a separated goroutine. Only the first response will be used, other slower ones will be discarded.

```go
func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	startTime := time.Now()
	// c must be a buffered channel
	c := make(chan int32, 5)
	for i := 0; i < cap(c); i++ {
		go source(c)
	}

	// Only the first response will be used
	rnd := <-c
	fmt.Println(time.Since(startTime))
	fmt.Println(rnd)
}

func source(c chan<- int32) {
	ra, rb := rand.Int31(), rand.Intn(3)+1
	// Sleep 1s/2s/3s
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(rb) * time.Second)
	c <- ra
}
```

Problem: unnecessary computation run in background

```go
func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)

	// c must be a buffered channel
	c := make(chan int32, 5)
	for i := 0; i < cap(c); i++ {
		go source(ctx, c)
	}

	// Only the first response will be used
	rnd := <-c
	cancel()

	fmt.Println(rnd)
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
}

var client = http.DefaultClient

func source(ctx context.Context, c chan<- int32) {
	now := time.Now()
	req, _ := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "http://localhost:8081", nil)
	req = req.WithContext(ctx)
	resp, err := client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("err: ", err)
	} else {
		data, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
		resp.Body.Close()
		log.Println("data: ", string(data), time.Since(now))

	}
	c <- rand.Int31()
}
```
Sometimes, a request is not guaranteed to be responded back a valid value. For all kinds of reasons, an error may be returned instead. For such cases, we can use a struct type like struct{v T; err error} or a blank interface type as the channel element type.

### Use Channels for Notifications

**1-to-1 notification by sending a value to a channel**

If there are no values to be received from a channel, then the next receive operation on the channel will block until another goroutine sends a value to the channel. So we can send a value to a channel to notify another goroutine which is waiting to receive a value from the same channel.

```go
func main() {
	done := make(chan struct{})

	go func() {
		// Notify job is done
		log.Println("notify job is done")
		done <- struct{}{}
	}()

	// waiting here for notification
	<-done
}
```

**N-to-1 notifications by WaitGroup**

**Broadcast 1-to-N notifications by closing a channel**

```go
func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	notify := make(chan struct{})

	go func() {
		<-notify
		fmt.Println("since: ", time.Since(now))
	}()
	go func() {
		<-notify
		fmt.Println("since: ", time.Since(now))
	}()

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	close(notify)
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```
