# 100 Go Mistake

Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tries anything new.

-- Albert Einstein

## 1. Unintended variable shadowing

The scope of a variable refers to the places a variable can be referenced. In Go, a variable name declared in a block may be re declared in an inner block. This called variable shadowing, is prone to common mistakes.

```go
func main() {
	var seted = false
	if true {
        // variable shadowing
		seted, err := fn()
		if err != nil {
		}
		log.Println(seted)
	} else {
        // variable shadowing
		seted, err := fn()
		if err != nil {
		}
		log.Println(seted)
	}

	log.Println(seted)
}

func fn() (bool, error) {
	return true, nil
}
```

Variable shadowing occurs when a variable name is re declared in an inner block, and we've seen that this practice is prone to mistakes

## 2. Misusing init functions

When a package is initialized, all the constants and variables declarations in the package are evaluated. Then, the init functions are executed.

**Anti pattern: to hold a database connection pool**

```go
var db *sql.DB
func init() {
    dataSourceName := os.Getenv("MYSQL_DATA_SOURCE_NAME")
    d, err := sql.Open("mysql", dataSourceName)
    if err != nil {
        log.Panic(err)
    }

    err = d.Ping()
    if err != nil {
        log.Panic(err)
    }
    db = d
}
```

**Let's describe three main downsides**

- Error management in an init function is limited, only ways to signal an error is to panic, leading application to be stopped
- init function will be executed before running the test cases
- Database connection pool is assigned to a global variable. Global variables have some severe drawbacks
+ Any functions can alter them within the package
+ It can also make unit test more complicated as a function that would depend on it 

**In summary, we have seen that init functions may lead to some issues:**

- Limit error management
- It can complicate how to implement tests
- If the initialization requires to set a state, it has to be done through global variables

## 3. Interface pollution

Interface pollution is about overwhelming our code with unnecessary abstractions making it harder to understand.
The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction

**When to use interfaces?**

- Common behavior
- Decoupling
- Restricting behavior

**Common behavior**
The first option we will discuss is to use interface when multiple types implement a common behavior. In such a case, we can factor out the behavior inside an interface.

```go
// Example, Interface in sort package
type Interface interface {
	Len() int
	Less(i, j int) bool
	Swap(i, j int)
}
```
Finding the right abstraction to factor out behavior can also bring many benefits.

**Decoupling**

If we rely on abstraction instead of a concrete implementation, the implementation itself can be replaceable with another without even having to change our code; this is the Liskov Substituition Principle.
One benefit of decoupling can be related to unit testing, for example.

```go
type CustomerService struct {
	store mysql.Store
}

func (cs CustomerService) CreateNewCustomer(id string) error {
	return cs.store.StoreCustomer(id)
}
```

Now, what if we want to test this method? As customerService relies on the actual implementation to store a Customer, we are obliged to test it through integration tests which require spinning up a MySQL instance. To give us more flexibility, we should decouple CustomerService from the actual implementation, which can be done via an interface:

```go
type customerStorer interface {
	StoreCustomer(string) error
}

type CustomerService struct {
	storer customerStorer
}

func (cs CustomerService) CreateNewCustomer(id string) error {
	return cs.store.StoreCustomer(id)
}
```

**Restricting behavior**

The last use case we will discuss can be pretty counter-intuitive at first sight. It's about restricting a type to a specific behavior.

```go
type IntConfig struct {
}

func (c *IntConfig) Get() int {}
func (c *IntConfig) Set(value int) {}
```

Now, suppose we receive an IntConfig that holds some specific configuration, such as a threshold. Yet, in our code, we are only interested in retrieving the config value, and we want to prevent updating it. How could we enforce that, semantically, this configuration is a read-only one if we don't want to change our configuration package?

```go
type intConfigGetter interface {
	Get() int
}
```

Then, in our code, we could rely on intConfigGetter instead of concrete implementation:

```go
type Foo struct {
	threshold intConfigGetter
}
func NewFoo(threshold intConfigGetter) Foo {
	return Foo{threshold: threshold}
}

func (f Foo) Bar() {
	threshold := f.threshold.Get()
}
```

**Interface pollution**

Create interfaces before concrete types shouldn't work in Go. As we discussed, interfaces are made to create abstractions. And the main caveat when programming meets abstractions is remembering that abstractions should be discovered, not created.

We shouldn't start by creating abstractions in our code if there is no immediate reason for it. We shouldn't design with interfaces but wait for a concrete need. We should create an interface when we need it, not when we foresee that we could need it.

What's the main problem if we overuse interfaces? The answer is that it makes the code flow more complex. Adding a useless level of indirection doesn't bring any value; it creates a useless abstraction making the code more difficult to read, understand and reason about.

If we don't have a strong reason for adding an interface and it's unclear how an interface makes a code better, we should challenge this interface's purpose. **Why not call the implementation directly?**

We can also not a performance overhead when calling a method through an interface. It requires a lookup in a hashtable data structure to find the concrete type it's pointing to. Yet, this isn't an issue an in many contexts as this overhead is minimal.

**Don't design with interfaces, discover them.**

## 4. Where should an interface live?

Some term should be clear

- Producer side: an interface defined in the same package as the concrete implementation
- Consumer side: an interface defined in an external package, where it's used

It's pretty common to see developers creating interfaces on the producer side, alongside the concrete implementation. This design is perhaps a habit from developers having a C# or a Java background. However, in Go, this is, in most cases, not what we should do.

We create a specific package to store and retrieve customer data. Meanwhile, we decide, still in the same package, that all the calls will have to go through the following interface:

```go
type CustomerStorage interface {
	Store(customer Customer) error
	Get(id string) Customer
	Update(customer Customer) error
	GetAll() ([]Customer, error)
	GetCustomersWithoutContract() ([]Customer, error)
	GetCustomersWithNegativeBalance() ([]Customer, error)
}
```

We might think we have some excellent reasons to create and expose this interface on the producer side. Perhaps it's a good way to decouple the client code from the actual implementation? 

Maybe another client wants to decouple his code but only interested in the GetAllCustomers method.

```go
package client

type customerGetter interface {
	GetAllCustomers() ([]store.Customer, error)
}
```
## 5. Returning interface

While designing a function signature, we may have to either return and interface or a concrete implementation. Let's understand why returning an interface is, in many cases, considered a bad practice in Go.

```go
package client

type Store interface {}
```

```go
package store

// InMemoryStore
type InMemoryStore struct {
}

func NewInMemoryStore() client.Store {
}
```
**Problems:** cyclic dependency 

In most cases, we can get inspiration from Postel's law:

Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others

If we apply this idiom to Go, it means:

- Returning struct instead of interfaces
- Accepting interfaces if possible

We shouldn't return interfaces but concrete implementations. Otherwise, it can make our design more complex due to package dependencies and restrict flexibility as all the clients would have to rely on the same abstraction. If we know than an abstraction will be helpful for clients, we can consider returning an interface. Otherwise, we shouldn't force abstractions, they should be discovered by clients. If a client needs to abstract an implementation for whatever reason, it can still do it on his side. 


## 6. Not being aware of the possible problems with type embedding

Let's see an example of a wrong usage. We will implement a struct that will hold some in-memory data, and we want to protect it against concurrent accesses using a mutex:

```go
type InMem struct {
	sync.Mutex
	m map[string]int
}

func New() *InMem {
	return &InMem{m: make(map[string]int)}
}

func (i *InMem) Get(key string) (int, bool) {
	// As the mutex is embedded, we can directly access the Lock and Unlock methods from
	// the i receiver
	i.Lock()
	v, contains := i.m[key]
	i.Unlock()

	return v, contains
}

func main() {
	m := inmem.New()
	// sync.Mutex is an embedded type, the Lock and Unlock methods will be promoted
	m.Lock() // ??
}

```

Let's see another example, but this time, embedding can be considered a correct approach. We want to write a customer logger that would contain an io.WriteCloser and expose two methods: Write and Close. If io.WriterClose isn't embedded, we would have to write it like so:

```go
type Logger struct {
	writerCloser io.WriteCloser
}

func (l Logger) Write(p []byte) (int, error) {
	return l.writerCloser.Write(p)
}

func (l Logger) Closer() error {
	return l.writerCloser.Closer()
}
```

```go
type Logger struct {
	io.WriteCloser
}
```

Different embedding from OOP subclassing can sometimes be confusing. The main difference is related to who is the receiver of a method. Embedding is about composition, not inheritance.

What should we conclude about type embedding?

First, let's note that it's rarely a necessity, and it means that whatever the usecase, we can probably solve it as well without type embedding. It's mainly used for convenience, in most cases to promote behaviors.

If we decide to use type embedding, we have to keep two main constraints in mind:

- It shouldn't be solely because of some syntactic sugar to simplify accessing a field ( e.g Foo.Baz() instead of Foo.Bar.Bar() ). If it's the only rationale, let's not embed the inner type and use a field instead.

- It shouldn't promote data (fields) or a behavior (methods) we want to hide from outside. For example, if it allows clients to access a locking behavior that should have remained private to the struct.

One may also argue that using type embedding could lead to extra efforts in terms of maintenance in the context of exported structs. Indeed, embedding a type inside an exported struct means remaining cautions when this type evolves. For example, if we add a new method in the inner type, we should ensure it doesn't break the latter constraint. Hence, to avoid this extra effort, teams can also prevent type embedding in public structs.

## 7. Not understand slice length and capacity

In Go, slice is backed by an array. It means the slice's data are stored contiguously in an array data struct. A slice also handles the logic of adding an element if the backing array is full or how to shrink the backing array if almost empty.

Internally, a slice holds a pointer towards the backing array plus a length and a capacity. The length is the number of elements the slice contains, whereas the capacity is the number of elements in the backing array.

Nil slice doesn't require any allocation, we should favor returning a nil slice.

```go
func f() []string {
	var s []string
	if foo() {
		s = append(s, "foo")
	}
	return s
}
```

Initialize a slice depending on the context:

```go
// if we aren't sure about the final length and the slice can be empty
var s []string

// create a nil and empty slice
[]string(nil)

// if the future length is known
make([]string, length[, capacity])

// should be avoid
[]string{}
```

Nil slices are always empty. Therefore, checking by checking the length of the slice, we cover all the scenarios:

- If the slice is nil: len(operations) != 0 will be false
- If the slice isn't nil but empty: len(operations) != 0 will also be false

## 8. Slice and memory leaks

This section will show that slicing an existing slice or array can lead to memory leaks in some conditions. 

**Capacity leak**

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	_ "net/http/pprof"
)

func main() {
	// pprof: go tool pprof -http localhost:9000 http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap
	go consumeMessages()

	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

func consumeMessages() {
	for {
		msg := receiveMessage()
		// Do something with msg
		storeHeader(getHeader(msg))
		log.Println("len header", len(_headers))
	}
}
func receiveMessage() []byte {
	return make([]byte, 0, 2<<20)
}

func getHeader(msg []byte) []byte {
	return msg[:5]
}

var (
	_headers [][]byte
)

func storeHeader(header []byte) {
	_headers = append(_headers, header)
}

```

The getMessageType function computes the message type by slicing the input slice. We test this implementation, and everything is fine. However, when we deploy our application, we notice that our application consumes about 1 GB of memory. How is it possible?

The slicing operation on msg using msg[:5] create a 5-length slice. However, its capacity remains the same capacity as the initial slice. The remaining elements are still allocated in memory, even if eventually msg will be referenced anymore

![leak capacity](assets/leak-capacity.png)

As we can notice in this figure, the backing array of the slice still contains one million bytes after the slicing operation. Hence, if we keep in memory 1000 messages, instead of storing about 5KB, we will hold about 1 GB.

So we can use copy to solve it

```go
func getHeader(msg []byte) []byte {
	// header is a 5-length, 5-capacity slice regardless of the size of the message received. Hence, we will store only 5 bytes per message type.
	header := make([]byte, 5)
	copy(header, msg)

	return header
}
```

We have to remember that slicing a large slice or array can lead to potential high memory consumption. Indeed, the remaining space won't be reclaimed by the GC, and we can keep a large backing array, despite using only a few elements. Using slice copy is the solution to prevent such a case.

**Slice and pointers**

We have seen that slicing can cause a leak because of the slice capacity. Those are still part of the backing array but outside the length range.

```go
type Foo struct {
	v []byte
}

func main() {
	// Allocate a slice of 1000 Foo elements
	foos := make([]Foo, 1_000)
	printAlloc()

	// iterate over each Foo element, and allocate for each one 1MB for the v slice
	for i := 0; i < len(foos); i++ {
		foos[i] = Foo{
			v: make([]byte, 1024*1024),
		}
	}
	printAlloc()

	two := keepFirstTwoElementsOnly(foos)
	runtime.GC()
	printAlloc()
	// runtime.KeepAlive to keep a reference to the two variable after the GC so that it won't be collected
	runtime.KeepAlive(two)
}

func keepFirstTwoElementsOnly(foos []Foo) []Foo {
	return foos[:2]
}

func printAlloc() {
	var m runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
	fmt.Printf("%d KB\n", m.Alloc/1024)
}

```
```txt
result
==========
333 KB
1024260 KB
1024264 KB
```

What's the reason?

The rule is the following, and it's essential to keep in mind while working with slices: if the element is a pointer or a struct with pointer fields, the elements won't be reclaimed by the GC.

So what are the options to ensure we don't leak the remaining Foo elements?

The first option, again, is to create a copy of the slice:

```go
func keepFirstTwoElementsOnly(foos []Foo) []Foo {
	res := make([]Foo, 2)
	copy(res, foos)
	return res
}
```

As we copy the first two elements of the slice, the GC will know that the 998 elements won't be referenced anymore and can be collected by the GC.

There's a second option if we want to keep the underlying capacity of 1000 elements, for example, which is mark the slices of the remaining elements to nil explicitly:

```go
func keepFirstTwoElementsOnly(foos []Foo) []Foo {
	for i := 2; i < len(foos); i++ {
		foos[i].v = nil
	}
	return foos[:2]
}
```

Here, we return a 2-length, 1000-capacity slice, but we set the slices of the remaining elements to nil. Hence, the GC will be able to collect the 998 backing arrays.

So, which option is the best? Depend on the proportion of the elements.

In this section, we have seen two potential memory leak problems. The first one is about slicing an existing slice or array to preserve the capacity. If we handle large slices and reslice them to keep only a fraction of it, a lot of memory will remain allocated but unused. The second one is when we use theslicing operation with elements being a pointer or a struct with pointer fields, we should know that the GC won’t reclaim these elements. In that case, the two options are to either perform a copy or mark the remaining elements or their fields to nil explicitly

## 9. Map and memory leak

```go
func mapWithoutInitialize() {
	m := make(map[int]int)
	for i := 0; i < 1e6; i++ {
		m[i] = i
	}
}

func mapWithInitialize() {
	m := make(map[int]int, 1e6)
	for i := 0; i < 1e6; i++ {
		m[i] = i
	}
}

```

```go
func BenchmarkMapWithout(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		mapWithoutInitialize()
	}
}

func BenchmarkMapWith(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		mapWithInitialize()
	}
}
```

Therefore, just like with slices, if we know upfront the number of elements a map will contain, we should create it by providing an initial size. Doing this avoids potential map growth, which is quite heavy computation-wise as it requires reallocating enough space and rebalancing all the elements.

## 10. Ignoring that elements are copied in range loops

In Go, everything we assign is a copy. For example, if we assign the result of a function returning:
- A struct, it will perform a copy of this struct
- A pointer, it will perform a copy of the memory address

```go
type account struct {
	balance int
}

func copyValue() {
	accounts := []account{
		{balance: 0},
		{balance: 1},
	}

	for _, acc := range accounts {
		acc.balance += 1000
	}
}
```

```go
func noCopyValue() {
	accounts := []account{
		{balance: 0},
		{balance: 1},
	}

	for i := 0; i < len(accounts) ; i++ {
		accounts[i].balance += 1000
	}
}
```

```go
func noCopyValue() {
	accounts := []*account{
		{balance: 0},
		{balance: 1},
	}

	for _, acc := range accounts {
		acc.balance += 1000
	}
}
```

In general, we should remember that the value element in a range loop is a copy. Therefore, if the value is a struct we need to mutate, we will only update the copy, not the element itself, unless the value or the field we modify is a pointer. The favored options are to access the element via the index using a rang loop or a classic for loop.

## 11. Ignoring how arguments are evaluated in range loops

What is result of this code?
```go
s := []int{0,1,2}
for range s {
	a = append(a, 10)
}
```

To understand this question, we should know that when using a rang loop, the provided expression is evaluated only once, before the beginning of the loop. In this context, evaluated means that the provided expression is copied to a temporary variable, and then range will iterate over this variable, not the original one. 

So, what is result of this code?
```go
a := [3]int{0,1,2}
for i, v := range a {
	a[2] = 10
	log.Println(v)
}
// 0,1,2
```

As we mentioned, the range operator creates a copy of the array. Meanwhile, the loop doesn't update the copy; it updates the original array: a. Therefore, the value of v during the last iteration is 2, not 10.

```go
// Solution: using an array pointer
a := [3]int{0,1,2}
for _, v := range &a {
	a[2] = 10
	log.Println(v)
}
// 0,1,10
```

In summary, the range loop evaluates the provided expression only once, before the beginning of the loop, by doing a copy (regardless of the type).

## 12. Ignoring the impacts of using pointer elements in range loops
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type store struct {
	m map[int]*int
}

func (s store) put(v []int) {
	for k, _v := range v {
		s.m[k] = &_v
	}
}

func main() {
	s := store{
		m: make(map[int]*int),
	}
	v := []int{1, 2, 3}

	s.put(v)
	for _, v := range s.m {
		fmt.Println(*v)
	}
	// 3 3 3
}

```

When iterating over a data structure using a range loop, we must recall that all the values are assigned to a unique variable with a single unique address. Therefore, if we store a pointer referencing this variable during each iteration, we will end up in a situation where we store the same pointer referencing the same element: the latest one. We can overcome this 	issue by forcing the creation of a local variable in the loop's scope or creating a pointer referencing a slice element via its index.

## 13. Map insert during iteration

In Go, updating a map (inserting or deleting an element) during an iteration is allowed; it doesn't lead to a compilation or a runtime error. However, there's another aspect that we should consider while adding an entry in a map during an iteration. Otherwise, it can lead to non-deterministic results.

```go
func main() {
	m := map[int]bool{
		0: true,
		1: false,
		2: true,
	}

	for k := range m {
		m[10+k] = true
		fmt.Println(m)
	}
}
```
The result of this code is unpredictable. If a map entry is created during iteration, it maybe produced during the iteration or skipped. The choice may vary for each entry created and from one iteration to the next. Hence, when an element is added to a map during an iteration, it may be produced during a follow-up iteration, or it may not. As Go developers, we don't have any way to enforce the behavior. 

It's essential to have this behavior in mind to ensure our code doesn't produce unpredictable outputs. If we want to update a map while iterating over it and make sure the added entries aren't part of the iteration, one solution it to work on a copy of the map like so:

```go
func main() {
	m := map[int]bool{
		0: true,
		1: false,
		2: true,
	}
	n := copyMap(m)

	for k := range n {
		m[10+k] = true
		// fmt.Printf("%p\n", m)
	}
	fmt.Println(m)
}

func copyMap(m map[int]bool) map[int]bool {
	n := make(map[int]bool)
	for k, v := range m {
		n[k] = v
	}
	return n
}
```
To summarize, when we work with a map, we shouldn't rely on:
- The ordering of the data by keys
- The preservation of the inserting order
- A deterministic iteration order
- The fact that an element added during an iteration will be produced during this iteration

## 14. Using defer inside a loop

The defer function statement delays a call's execution until the surrounding function returns. One common mistake is to be unaware of the sequences of using defer inside a loop.

We will implement a function that opens a set of files where the paths will be received via a channel. Hence, we will have to iterate over this channel, open the files and handle the closure.
```go
func readFiles(ch <- chan string) error {
	for path := range ch {
		file, err := os.Open(path)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		// in this case, the defer calls will be executed not during each loop iteration but when the readFiles function returns. IF readFiles doesn't return,
		// the file descriptors will be kept open forever, causing leaks.
		defer file.Close()
	}
	return nil
}
```

How to fix it? We can encapsulate readFile logic to another function, then we can use defer to close file without causing leaks. 
```go
func readFiles(ch <- chan string) error {
	for path := range ch {
		if err := readFile(path); err != nil {
			return err
		}
	}
	return nil
}

func readFile(path string) error {
	file, err := os.Open(path)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// defer function is call when readFile return
	defer file.Close()

	return nil
}
```

When using defer, we must remember that it schedules a function call when the surrounding function returns. Hence, calling defer function within a loop will stack all the calls: they won't be executed during each iteration, which may cause memory leaks if the loop doesn't terminate. 

## 15. Not understanding the concept of rune

- A charset is set of characters, whereas an encoding describes how to translate a charset into binary.
- In Go, a string references an immutable slice of arbitrary bytes
- A Go source code is encoded using UTF-8. Hence, all string literals are UTF-8 strings. Yet, a string can contain arbitrary bytes, if it's obtained from another place (not the source code), it isn't guaranteed to be based on the UTF-8 encoding.
- A rune corresponds to a Unicode code point concept, meaning an item represented by a single value.
- Using UTF-8, a Unicode code point can be encoded from one to for bytes.
- Using len on a string in Go returns the number of bytes, not the number of runes.

## 16. Inaccurate string iteration

```go
s := "hêllo"
fmt.Println(len(s))
for i := range s {
	fmt.Printf("position %d: %c\n", i, s[i])
}
fmt.Printf("len=%d\n", len(s))
// position 0: h
// position 1: Ã
// position 3: l
// position 4: l
// position 5: o
// len=6
```

We assigned to s a string literal, s is a UTF-8 string. Meanwhile, the special character ê isn't encoded in a single byte; it requires two bytes. Therefore, calling len(s) returns 6.

What if we want get the number of runes in a string, not the number of bytes? It depends on the encoding. In the previous example, as we assigned a string literal to s, it's a UTF-8 string. Hence, we can use the unicode/utf8 package:

```go
fmt.Println(utf8.RuneCountInString(s)) // 
```

Let's get back to the iteration to understand the remaining surprises:

```go
for i := range s {
	fmt.Printf("position %d: %c\n", i, s[i])
}
// position 0: h
// position 1: Ã
// position 3: l
// position 4: l
// position 5: o
```

We have to understand that in this example, we don't iterate over each rune; instead over each starting index of rune.

## 17. Under-optimized strings concatenation

When it comes to concatenating strings, in Go, there are two main ways to do it, and one can be really inefficient in some conditions. 

```go
func concat(values []string) string {
	s := ""
	for _, value := range values {
		s += value
	}
	return s
}
```

During each iteration, the += operator concatenates s with the value string. At first sight, this function may not look wrong. Yet, with this implementation, we forget one of the core characteristics of a string: its immutability. Therefore, each iteration doesn't update s; it reallocates a new string in memory, which significantly impacts the performance of this function.

Internally strings.Builder holds a byte slice. Each call to WriteString results in a call to append on this slice. There are two impacts. First this struct shouldn't be used concurrently as the calls to append would lead to race conditions. The second impact is something that we already saw in Inefficient slice initialization: if the future length of a slice is already known, we should preallocate it. For that purpose, strings.Builder exposes a method: Grow(n int) to guarantee space for another n bytes.

```go
func concat(values []string) string {
	total := 0
	for i := 0; i < len(values); i++ {
		total += len(values[i])
	}
	sb := strings.Builder{}
	sb.Grow(total)
	for _, value := range values {
		_, _ = sb.WriteString(value)
	}
	return sb.String()
}
```

## 19. Substring and memory leaks


## 20. Not understanding addressable values in Go

One of the tricky concepts in Go is addressable values. There are a number of important things that are not addressable. For example, values in a map and the return values from function and method calls are not addressable. The following are all errors:

```go
&m["key"]
&afunc()
&t.method()
```
The return value of a function only becomes addressable when put into a variable:

```go
v := afunc()
&v
```

## 21. Now knowing which type of receiver to use

**A receiver must be a pointer**

- If the method needs to mutate the receiver. This rule is also valid if the receiver is a slice and a method needs to append elements:

```go
type slice []int
func (s *slice) add(element int) {
	*s = append(*s, element)
}
```
- If the method receiver contains a field that cannot be copied for example, a type part of the sync package

**A receiver should be a pointer**

- If the receiver is a large object. Indeed, using a pointer could make the call more efficient as it prevents making an extensive copy.

**A receiver must be a value**
- If we have to enforce a receiver's immutability
- If the receiver is a map, a function, or a channel; otherwise it leads to compilation error.

**A receiver should be a value**
- If the receiver is a slice that doesn't have to be mutated
- If the receiver is a small array or struct
- If the receiver is a basic type such as int, float64 or string

By default, we can choose to go with a value receiver unless there's a good reason not to do so. In doubt, we should use a pointer receiver.

## 22. Returning a nil receiver

Let's consider the following example.

```go
func main() {
	err := convError()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}

type Foo struct{}

func (f *Foo) Error() string {
	return "error"
}

func convError() error {
	var foo *Foo // foo is nil pointer
	// do something
	return foo // foo is converted to error with Error(): foo.Error() 
}

func convErrorGood() error {
	var foo *foo
	// do something
	if foo == nil {
		return nil
	}
	return foo
}
```

We've seen in this section that in Go, having a nil receiver is allowed, and an interface converted from a nil pointer isn't a nil interface. For that reason, when we have to return an interface, we shouldn't return a nil pointer but a nil value directly. Generally, having a nil pointer isn't a desirable state and means a probable bug.

We saw an example with errors throughout this section as it's the most common case leading to this error. Yet, please note that this problem isn't tied to errors. It can happen with any interface implemented using pointer receivers.


## 23. Ignoring how defer arguments and receivers and evaluated

Explain ?
```go
func main() {
	var s = "ngoctd"
	fmt.Printf("%p\n", &s)

	fn(s)

	defer func() {
		fmt.Printf("%p\n", &s)
		fn(s)
	}()

	defer fn(s)
}

func fn(s string) {
	fmt.Printf("%p\n", &s)
}

// 0xc000010250
// 0xc000010260
// 0xc000010270
// 0xc000010250
// 0xc000010280
```

```go
func main() {
	var s = Struct{id: "ngoctd"}
	fmt.Printf("%p\n", &s)

	s.print()

	defer func() {
		fmt.Printf("x %p\n", &s)
		s.print()
	}()

	defer s.print()
}

type Struct struct {
	id string
}

func (s Struct) print() {
	fmt.Printf("%p\n", &s)
}

// 0xc00009e210
// 0xc00009e220
// 0xc00009e230
// 0xc00009e210
// 0xc00009e240
```

In summary, we must remind that when calling defer on a function or method, the call's arguments are evaluated immediately. If we want to mutate the arguments provided to defer afterward, we can use pointers or closures. For a method, the receiver is also evaluated immediately; hence, the behavior depends on whether the receiver is a value or a pointer.

- Deciding on using either value or pointer receiver should be
made according to various factors such as the type, if it has
to be mutated, if it contains a field that can’t be copied, and
how large the object is. In doubt, we should use a pointer
receiver.
- Using named result parameters can be an efficient way to
improve the readability of a function/method, especially if
multiple result parameters have the same type. In some
cases, it can also be convenient as they will be initialized to
their zero value. Yet, we have to be cautious about potential
side effects.
- When returning an interface, we have to be cautious about
not returning a nil pointer but an explicit nil value.
Otherwise, it may lead to unintended consequences as the
caller will receive a non-nil value.
- Designing functions to receive io.Reader types instead of
filenames improves the reusability of a function and makes
testing easier.
- Passing a pointer to a defer function or wrapping a call
inside a closure are two possible solutions to overcome
arguments and receivers being evaluated immediately.

## 24. Ignoring when to wrap an error

Different between fmt.Errorf("%w") and fmt.Errorf("%v")

```go
// wraps the source error to add additional context without having to create another error type
if err != nil {
	return fmt.Errorf("bar failed: %w", err)
}

// Here, the error it self isn't wrapped. We transform it into another error to add context but the source code error itself isn't available
if err != nil {
	return fmt.Errorf("bar failed: %v", err)
}
```

Wrapping an error makes the source error available for callers. Hence, it means introducing potential coupling. If we want to make sure our client don't rely on something that we consider as implementation details, then the error returned shouldn't be wrapped but transformed.

## 25. Concurrency is not parallelism

Concurrency enables parallelism. Indeed, concurrency provides a structure to solve a problem with parts that may be parallelized.

Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
-- Rob Pike

Concurrency and parallelism are different. Concurrency is about structure, and we can change a sequential implementation into a concurrent one by introducing different steps that separate concurrent threads can tackle. Meanwhile, parallelism is about execution, and we can leverage it at the level of a step by adding more parallel threads.

A thread is the smallest unit of processing that an OS can perform. If a process wants to process multiple actions simultaneously, it will spin up multiple threads. These threads can be:
- Concurrent when two or more threads can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods.
- Parallel when the same task can be executed multiple times at once.
  
The OS is responsible for scheduling the thread's process most optimally so that:
- All the threads can consume CPU cycles without being starved for too much time
- The workload is distributed as evenly as possible among the different CPU cores.

A CPU core executes different threads. When it switches from one thread to another, it executes an operation called context switching. The active thread consuming CPU cycles was in an executing state and moved to runnable state, meaning ready to executed but pending an available core. Context switching is considered an expensive operations as the OS needs to save the current execution state of a thread before the switch.

Internally, the Go scheduler uses the following terminology:
- G: Goroutine
- M: OS thread (Machine) 
- P: CPU core (Processor)

Each OS thread (M) is assigned to CPU core (P) by the OS scheduler. Then each Goroutine (G) runs on an OS thread (M).

A goroutine has a simpler than an OS thread. It can be either:
- Executing: the goroutine is scheduled on an M and executing its instruction
- Runnable: waiting for being in an executing state
- Waiting: stopped and pending for something to complete, such as a system call or a synchronization operation (mutex)

When a goroutine is created but cannot be executed yet. For example, all the other Ms are already executing a G. In this scenario, what will the Go runtime do about it? The answer is queuing. Indeed, the Go runtime handles two kinds of queues: one local queue per P and a global queue shared among all the Ps. 

```go
func runtime.Schedule() {
	// Only 1/61 of the time, check the global runnable queue for a G.
	// If not found, check the local queue
	// If not found,
	// 		Try to steal from other Ps.
	// 		If not, check the global runnable queue.
	// 		If not found, poll network
}
```
Every 1/61 execution, the Go scheduler will check whether goroutines from the global queue are available. If not, it will check its local queue. Meanwhile, if both the global and the local queues are empty, it can pick up goroutines from other local queues. This principle in scheduling is called work-stealing, and it allows an underutilized processor to actively look for other processor's goroutine and steal one. Go scheduler is now preemptive. It means that when a goroutine is running for a specific amount of time (10ms), it will be marked preemptible and can be context-switched off to be replaced by another goroutine. It allows a long-running job to be forced to share CPU time.

## 26. Not understanding race problems 

Race problems can be among the hardest and the most insidious bugs a programmer can face. As Go developers, we must understand aspects such as the data races and race conditions, their possible impacts, and how to avoid them. 

A data race occurs when two or more goroutines simultaneously access the same memory location, and at least one is writing.

```go
i := 0
go func() {
	i++
}()
go func() {
	i++
}()
```

Data races occur when multiple goroutines access the same memory location simultaneously, and at least one of them is writing. We have also been how to prevent it with three synchronization approaches:
- Using atomic operations
- Protecting a critical section with a mutex
- Using communication and channels to ensure a variable is updated only by a single goroutine.

```go
i := 0
var m sync.Mutex
var wg sync.WaitGroup

wg.Add(2)
go func() {
	defer wg.Done()

	m.Lock()
	defer m.Unlock()
	i = 1
}()

go func() {
	defer wg.Done()

	m.Lock()
	defer m.Unlock()

	m++
}()

wg.Wait()
fmt.Println(m)
```

This example doesn't lead to a data race. Yet, it has a race condition. A race condition occurs when the behavior depends on the sequence or the timing of events that can't be controlled. When we work in concurrent applications, it's essential to understand that a data race is different from a race condition. A data race occurs when multiple goroutines simultaneously access the same memory location, and at least one of them is writing. An application can be free of data races but can still have its behavior depending on uncontrolled events

## 27. The Go memory model

The Go memory model is specification that defines the conditions under which a read from a variable in one goroutine can be guaranteed to happen after a write to the same variable in a different goroutine.

## 28. Not understand the concurrency impacts of a workload type

In programming, the execution time of a workload is either limited by:

- The speed of the CPU. For example, running a merge sort algorithm. The workload is called CPU-bound.
- The speed of I/O. For example, making a REST call or query in DB. The workload is called I/O bound.
- The amount of available memory. The workload is called memory bound.

Why is it important to classify a workload in the context of a concurrent application? Let's understand it alongside one concurrency pattern: worker pooling.

## 29. Misunderstanding Go contexts

Developers sometimes misunderstood the context.Context type despite being one of the key concepts of the language and being one of the foundations of concurrent code in Go.

**Context value**
A Context carries a deadline, a cancellation signal, and other values across API boundaries.
Internally, context.WithTimeout creates a goroutine that will be retained in memory for duration or until cancel is called. Therefore, calling cancel as a defer function means that when we exit the parent function, the context will be canceled, and the goroutine created will be stopped. It's a safeguard to not return in leaving retained object in memory.

**Context signal**
Another use case for Go contexts is to carry a cancellation signal.

```go
func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		if i == 5 {
			cancel()
		}
		fn(ctx)
	}
}

func fn(ctx context.Context) {
	select {
	default:
		fmt.Println("RUN")
	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Println("Done, close file")
	}
}

```


**Context values**

**Catching a context cancellation**

The context.Context type exports a Done method that returns a receive-only notification channel <- chan struct{}. This channel is closed when the work associated to the context should be canceled. One thing to mention, why should the internal channel be closed when a context is canceled or has met a deadline instead of receiving a specific value? Because the closure of a channel is the only channel action that all the consumer goroutines will receive. This way, all the consumers will be notified once a context is canceled or a deadline is reached.

Furthermore, context.Context exports an Err method that returns nil if the Done channel isn't yet closed; otherwise, it returns a non-nil error explaining why the Done channel was closed. A context.Canceled error if the channel was canceled. A context.DeadlineExceeded error if the context's deadline passed.

```go
func f(ctx context.Context) error {
	ch1 <- struct{}{}
	v := <-ch2
}

func f(ctx context.Context) error {
	// send message to ch1 or wait for the context to be canceled
	select {
	case <- ctx.Done():
		return ctx.Err()
	case ch1 <- struct{}{}:
	}

	// receive a message from ch2 or wait for the context to be canceled
	select {
	case <- ctx.Done():
		return ctx.Err()
	case v := <- ch2:
	}
}
```

## 30. Propagating and inappropriate context

Sometimes, context propagation can lead to subtle bugs, preventing subfunctions from being correctly executed.

```go
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	response, err := doSomeTask(r.Context(), r)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), 500)
		return
	}
	go func() {
		err := publish(r.Context(), response)
	}()
	writeResponse(response)
}
```

We have to know that the context attached to an HTTP request can cancel in different conditions:
- When the client's connection closes
- In the case of an HTTP/2 request, when the request is canceled
- Or when the response has been written back to the client

When the response has been written to the client, the context associated with the request will be canceled. Therefore, we are facing a race condition:
- If writing the response is done after the Kafka publication, we both return a response and publish message successfully.
- However, if writing the response is done before or during the Kafka publication, the message may not be published.

So how can we fix this issue? One idea could be not to propagate the parent context. Instead, we would call publish with an empty context:

```go
err := publish(context.Background(), response)
```
But, sometime context contained some useful values. For example, if the context contained a correlation ID used for distributed tracing, we can correlate the HTTP request and the Kafka publication. Ideally, we would like to have a new context, detached from the potential parent cancellation, but that still conveys the values.

```go
type detachContext struct {
	ctx context.Context
}

// Deadline implements context.Context
func (detachContext) Deadline() (deadline time.Time, ok bool) {
	return time.Time{}, false
}

// Done implements context.Context
func (detachContext) Done() <-chan struct{} {
	return nil
}

// Err implements context.Context
func (detachContext) Err() error {
	return nil
}

// Value implements context.Context
func (d detachContext) Value(key any) any {
	return d.ctx.Value(key)
}
```
In summary, propagating a context should be done cautionsly. We illustrated this section with an example of handling an asynchronous action based on a context associated with an HTTP request. As the context is canceled once we return the response, the asynchronous action can also get stopped unexpectedly. Let's bear in mind the impacts of propagating a given context and if necessary, let's also keep in mind that it would always be possible to create our custom context for specific action.

## 31. Starting a goroutine without knowing when to stop it

In term of memory, a goroutine starts with a minimum 2KB stack size, which can grow and shrink as needed (with a max stack size of 1GB on 64-bit, 250MB on 32-bit). Memory-wise, a goroutine can also hold variable references allocated to the heap. Meanwhile, a goroutine can hold resources such as HTTP or DB connections, open files, network sockets that should be closed gracefully eventually. If a goroutine is leaked, these kinds of resources will also be leaked.

```go
ch := foo()
go func() {
	for v := range ch {

	}
}()
```
The created goroutine will exit when ch is closed. Yet, do we know exactly when this channel will be closed? 

## 32. Expecting a deterministic behavior using select and channels

Unlike a switch statement where the first case with a match wins, the select statement will select one randomly if multiple options are possible. This behavior might look odd at first, but there's a good reason for that: to prevent possible starvation. Indeed, suppose the first possible communication chosen is based on the source code. In that case, we may fall into the situation where we would solely receive from one single channel because of a fast sender, for example. To prevent this, the language designers have decided to use a random selection.

## 33. Not using notification channels

## 34. Being puzzled about a channel size

## Not understanding CPU caches

Make it correct, make it clear, make it concise, make it fast, in that order.

**CPU architecture**

Modern CPUs rely on caching to speed up memory access. In most cases, via three different caching levels: L1 64 KB, L2 256 KB, and L3, 4MB. Dividing a physical core into multiple logical cores is named in the Intel family as hyper-threading. Each physical core (core 0 and core 1) is divided into two logical cores. Regarding the L1 cache it's slit into two sub-caches: L1D for data and L1I for instructions (each of 32KB). 

**Cache line**
When a specific memory location is accessed (e.g reading a variable), it is likely that in the near future:

- The same location will be referenced again
- Nearby memory locations will be referenced

The former refers to temporal locality, and the later refers to spatial locality. Both are part of a principle called locality of reference.

```go
func sum(s []int64) int64 {
	var total int64
	length := len(s)
	for i := 0; i < length; i++ {
		total += s[i]
	}
	return total
}
```
In this example, temporal locality applies to multiple variables: i, length, and total. Indeed, throughout the iteration, we keep accessing the these variables. Furthermore, spatial locality applies to code instructions and the slice, s. Indeed, as a slice is backed by an array allocated contiguously in memory, in this example, accessing s[0] means also accessing s[1], s[2], etc.

Temporal locality is part of why we need CPU caches: to speed up repeated accesses to the same variables. However, because of spatial locality, the CPU will copy what we call a cache line instead of copying a single variable from the main to memory to a cache.

**Slice of structs vs struct of slices**
