## The Document Model in MongoDB

- MongoDB stores data as Documents
- Document fields can be values, embedded documents, or arrays of values and documents
- MongoDB is a Flexible Schema database

## Constraints in Data Modeling

- Keep the frequently used Documents in RAM
- Keep the indexes in RAM
- Prefer SSD to Hard Disk Drives
- Infrequently data can use Hard Disk Drives

## The Data Modeling Methodology 

- Workload: data size, important reads and writes
- Relationships: identify them, link or embed the related entities
- Patterns: Appply the ones for needed optimizations

## Model for Simplicity or Performance

## Identify the Workload

**Scenarios**
- 10 Million devices send data
- Devices can collect and send data every minute
- Most trends (not all) can be identified with hourly data
- Keep the data for 10 years
- Ops need to identify faulty/non-responsive devices
- Ops need to assemble/merge data for DA
- Data Analysts run analytic queries
