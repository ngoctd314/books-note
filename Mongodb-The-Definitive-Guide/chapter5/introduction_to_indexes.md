## Introduction to indexes

A database index is similar to a book's index. Instead of looking through the whole book, the database takes a shortcut and just looks at an ordered list with references to the content.

A query that does not use an index is called a collection scan, which means that the server has to "look through the whole book" to find a query's results.
